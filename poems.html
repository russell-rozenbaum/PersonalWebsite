            A weed,
            a flower?
            A tree,
            a sapling?

            A seed,
            a nodule.
            A need, 
            a happening.

          <div class="poem-content">
            It never really was.

            It's once the handler's intrigued,
            That they want to see
            
            The other side.
            
            You sit in a room filled with treasures,
            Heated to the just right the temperature,
            Filled with all your greatest pleasures.
            On a sofa lies you and your contentedness, serenity, comfort, and peace,
            All of which have contributed to keeping that door locked, chained shut. Closed.
            In a fear of you losing your comfort you've worked oh-so-hard to obtain.
            
            It's once you're intrigued,
            That you want to see.
            
            It's once you are blind, broken, deaf, and feeble
            That you crave something more.
            
            It's once you are swallowed by the gallows of fear, despise, grief, and demise
            That you want out.
            
            You want out, you want out.
            
            You want to know,
            What lies on that other side.
            
            That very door that has kept you enclosed in comfort for so long now,
            Has seamlessly entrapped you within your own rue, regret, and remorse.
            
            What you missed was the filth, 
            The byproduct, 
            The problems,
            The consequences,
            Of your peace,
            Comfort,
            Serenity,
            Contentedness,
            Piling up around you.
            
            You never vacuumed beneath the sofa,
            Checked the ceiling for leaky pipes,
            Tended to the amenities of your own livelihood.
            
            It gets harder and harder to breathe as dust fills the air.
            It gets denser and denser as the ceiling caves in around you.
            It gets colder and colder as the central heating begins to fail.
            
            You want out, you want out, you scream this time;
            It merely echoes off the walls and the door which have surrounded you for so long now.
            
            You want out, you want out, and it seems so close,
            For that other side has always existed, 
            
            It has, right?
            
            You neglected to peer through the aperture,
            Until the sense of entitlement was at risk.
            
            Lazy? Disinterested? Ignorant? Abusive? 
            Content. Serene. Comfortable. At peace.
            
            You never really were.
            
            Don't you see?
            
            You never really were.
            
            You don't see?
            
            Well open the door,
            Why wouldn't you open the door?
            
            You see?
            
            That door you want open,
            Will never be opened.
            
            For it never really was.
            
            That door you want open,
            Will never be opened,
            
            That door,
            A wall — A paradigm.

            <div class="poem-date">April 28, 2023</div>
            <div class="poem-content">
                Death, seen as merely a one-time occurrence.
                A faux-construct, a forever happening?
                
                From the beginning, a life was so pure,
                Through the living, a light faded into darkness.
                
                Memories, rue, guilt, grief.
                
                Death, signifying the end of a life,
                Yet proving the very existence of one.

            <div class="poem-title">The Inability to Change</div>
            <div class="poem-date">June 29, 2023</div>
            <div class="poem-content">
                Is it the person who cannot change their own ways, their own story, their own self?

Or is it the person who cannot change the eyes which peer upon them,
The person who cannot change the scars which were engraved,
The person who cannot change the figure who was cemented.

Is it the person, or the society, who creates the inability to change?

Given the right tools, guidance, and care, even a hyena can be serene.
But the most difficult step to serenity for the hyena,
Will always be overcoming the social constructs which deem them otherwise.

Change becomes peace, punishment becomes violence. It's society who picks which to nurture.

Let them hum,

Throughout the crisp pale air,
Birds hum,
Swarm,
And chirp.

Let them hum,
Swarm,
And chirp.

Amongst the rustic fertile clay,
Ants hum,
Swarm,
And chirp.

Let them hum,
Swarm,
And chirp.

Upon the fluorescent lushious Earth,
We suffocate,
Deplete, 
And silence.

May we one day, 
Hum,
Swarm,
And chirp.

            <div class="poem-date">Nov 9, 2024</div>
            <div class="poem-content">
                Here we wake in a nocturnal slumber,
                have you slurped the lemon fuzz from the beaver's lumber?
                Or perhaps sipped the mossy touch in a jovial wonder,
                while finding strange pleasure in a meaningful blunder?
                
                A sauntering of paracosms, all well and fed.
                They've nurtured who you are, but it's not til' your dead,
                When you smoke the foggy bloom, whilst lying in the garden bed,
                Peering out to the moon, who's crevices' are bled.
                
                This sapling had grown, in the midst of your thunder,
                But to a blightful dismay, condoned an inevitable sunder.
